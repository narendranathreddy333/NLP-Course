1,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
2,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
3,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
4,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
5,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
6,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
7,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
8,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
9,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
10,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive
11,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
12,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
13,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
14,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
15,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
16,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
17,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
18,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
19,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
20,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
21,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
22,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

24,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
25,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
26,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
27,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
28,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
29,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
30,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
31,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
32,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
33,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
34,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
35,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

37,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high.

42,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe.

The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated.

44,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
45,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
46,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
47,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

49,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
50,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
51,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
52,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
53,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
54,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
55,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
56,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
57,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
58,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
59,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
60,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

62,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
67,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
68,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
69,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
70,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
71,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
72,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

74,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
75,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
76,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
77,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
78,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
79,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
80,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
81,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
82,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
83,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
84,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
85,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

87,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
88,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
89,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
90,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
91,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
92,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
93,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
94,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
95,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
96,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
97,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

99,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
100,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
101,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
102,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
103,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
104,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
105,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
106,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
107,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
108,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
109,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
110,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
117,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
118,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
119,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
120,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
121,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

124,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
125,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
126,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
127,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
128,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
129,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
130,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
132,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
133,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
134,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
135,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive
136,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
137,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
138,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
139,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
140,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
141,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
142,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
143,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
144,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
145,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
146,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

149,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
150,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
151,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
152,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
153,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
154,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
155,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
156,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
157,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
158,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
159,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
160,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

165,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet.

166,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
167,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
168,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen.

As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

169,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
170,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
171,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

174,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
175,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
176,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
177,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
178,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
179,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
180,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
181,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
182,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
183,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
184,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
185,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive
186,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter.

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
187,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
188,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

190,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
191,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
192,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
193,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
194,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
195,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
196,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

199,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
200,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
201,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
203,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
204,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
205,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
206,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
207,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
208,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
209,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
210,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
212,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
213,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
215,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
216,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
217,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive

219,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral

Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
221,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it.

225,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
226,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
227,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
228,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
229,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
230,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
231,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
232,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
233,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
234,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
235,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high.

242,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive

244,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral

Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive

Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
247,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

249,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
250,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
251,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
252,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
253,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
254,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
255,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
256,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
257,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
258,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
259,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
260,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
267,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
269,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
270,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
271,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
272,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

274,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
275,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
276,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
277,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
278,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
279,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
280,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
281,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
282,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
283,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
284,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
285,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
287,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

290,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
291,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
292,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
293,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
294,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
295,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
296,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

299,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
300,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
301,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
302,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
303,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
304,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
305,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
306,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
307,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
308,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
309,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
310,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

312,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
313,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

315,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
317,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
318,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
319,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
320,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
321,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

324,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
325,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
326,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
327,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
328,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
329,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
330,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
331,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
332,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
333,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
334,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
335,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
342,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
343,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
344,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
345,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
346,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

349,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
350,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
351,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive

I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
353,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
354,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
355,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
357,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
358,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
359,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
360,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
362,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
363,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
364,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
365,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
366,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
367,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
368,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

369,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
370,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
371,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

374,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
375,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
376,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
377,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
378,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
379,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive

This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
381,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
382,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
383,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
384,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
385,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive
386,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
387,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
388,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
389,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
390,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
391,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
392,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
393,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
394,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
395,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
396,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

399,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
400,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
401,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
402,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
403,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
405,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
406,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
407,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
408,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
409,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
410,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
413,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

415,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
417,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive

419,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral

Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive

Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

424,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
425,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
426,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
427,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
428,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
429,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
430,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
431,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
432,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
433,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
434,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
435,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

440,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
442,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive

444,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral

Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive

It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

449,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
450,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
451,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
452,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
453,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
454,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
455,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
456,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
457,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
458,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
459,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
460,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary.

The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe.

The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability.

There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
470,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
471,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

474,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
475,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
476,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
477,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
478,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
479,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
480,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
481,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
482,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
483,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
484,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
485,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
492,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
493,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
494,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
495,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
496,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

499,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
500,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
501,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
502,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
503,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
504,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
505,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
506,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
507,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
508,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
509,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
510,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

512,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
513,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
514,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
515,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
516,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
517,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
518,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
519,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
520,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
521,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

524,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
525,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
526,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
527,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
528,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
529,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
530,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
531,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
532,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
533,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
534,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
535,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
542,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
543,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
544,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
545,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
546,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

549,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
550,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
551,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
552,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
553,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
554,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
555,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
557,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive

Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
559,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
560,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive
561,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
562,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
563,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
564,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
565,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
566,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
567,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
568,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
569,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
570,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
571,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

574,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
575,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
576,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
577,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
578,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
579,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
580,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
581,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
582,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
583,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
584,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
585,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

590,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet.

591,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
592,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
593,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen.

As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
594,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
595,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
596,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

599,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
600,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
601,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
602,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
603,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
604,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
605,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
606,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
607,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
608,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
609,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
610,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive
611,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter.

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
613,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
614,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
615,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
616,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
617,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
618,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time.

619,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
620,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
621,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

624,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
625,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
626,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
628,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
629,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
630,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
631,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
632,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
633,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
634,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
635,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

640,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
642,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive

644,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral

Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive

Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it.

650,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
651,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
652,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
653,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
654,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
655,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
656,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
657,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
658,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
659,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
660,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high.

667,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated.

669,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral

I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead.

It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
672,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

674,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
675,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
676,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
677,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
678,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
679,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
680,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
681,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
682,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
683,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
684,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
685,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high.

692,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
694,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
695,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
696,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
697,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

699,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
700,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
701,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
702,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
703,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
704,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
705,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
706,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
707,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
708,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
709,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
710,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
712,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

715,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
716,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
717,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
718,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
719,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
720,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
721,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

724,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
725,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
726,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
727,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
728,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
729,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
730,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
731,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
732,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
733,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
734,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
735,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
737,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

740,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
742,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
743,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen.

As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

744,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
745,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
746,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

749,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
750,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
751,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
752,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
753,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
754,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
755,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
757,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
758,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
759,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
760,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
767,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
768,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
769,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
770,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
771,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

774,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
775,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
776,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive

I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
778,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
779,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
780,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
782,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
783,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
784,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
785,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive
786,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter.

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
787,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
788,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
789,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
790,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
791,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
792,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
793,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

794,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
795,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
796,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

799,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
800,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
801,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
802,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
803,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
804,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive

This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
806,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
807,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
808,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
809,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
810,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive
811,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
812,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
813,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
814,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
815,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
816,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
817,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
818,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
819,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
820,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
821,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

824,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
825,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
826,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
827,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
828,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
830,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
831,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
832,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
833,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
834,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
835,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
838,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

840,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
842,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive

844,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral

Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive

Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

849,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
850,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
851,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
852,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
853,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
854,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
855,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
856,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
857,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
858,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
859,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
860,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

865,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
867,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated.

869,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral

I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead.

It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

874,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
875,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
876,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
877,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
878,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
879,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
880,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
881,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
882,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
883,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
884,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
885,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary.

The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe.

The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability.

There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
895,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
896,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
897,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

899,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
900,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
901,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
902,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
903,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
904,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
905,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
906,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
907,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
908,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
909,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
910,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production.

Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
917,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
918,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
919,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
920,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
921,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
922,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

924,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
925,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
926,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
927,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
928,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
929,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
930,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
931,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
932,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
933,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
934,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
935,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

937,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
938,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
939,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
940,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
941,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
942,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
943,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
944,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
945,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
946,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

949,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
950,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
951,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
952,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
953,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
954,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
955,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
956,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
957,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
958,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
959,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
960,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive

I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years.

At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
967,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
968,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy.

This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
969,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
970,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
971,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive

974,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
975,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
976,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
977,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
978,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
979,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
980,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...",positive
982,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of ""Barbie"" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",positive
983,"I saw this yesterday along with several other movies, that's why I'm reviewing the next day. Poor Things is very well-made, smoothly written throughout, with excellent cinematography, and a rivetingly bizarre experience that is so worthy of award recognition! It is dystopian vibe reminds me of Terry Gilliam's style. Yorgos is exceptional at his craft involving surgical creations, color palettes different from most, and enriching dialogue that is clever yet sometimes weird in all his movies. Emma Stone deserves praise and Willem Dafoe is master class as always. The film might not be for everyone but it's surely impressive and deserving of the 8.5 rating.",neutral
984,"""I must go punch that baby.""The first film of the Leeds International Film Festival 2023 (LIFF), and what a strong start!Poor Things is a humorous, sexy, and Gothic tale that can be philosophically but in the most bizarre ways. There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very ""risky"" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, ""Never go full stupid"", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, ""Alright, I get it.""Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",positive
985,"Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, ""Poor Things"" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as ""God"", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in ""The Favourite"", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The ""Frankenstein""-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she ""grows"" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a ""Gulliver's Travels"" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, ""Poor Things"" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",positive
986,"There's a Doctor, Godwin Baxter, who can conjure - a variety of cut and shuts of wonder, he can pair the misaligned, outlandish tissues become twined, as he nurtures what's been lost, to form a daughter. He calls her Bella, she's a beauty to behold, musters wisdom to make sense of what she's sold, has the temper of a child, her carnal journey is quite wild, after Wedderburn, acquires her freehold. But this lady will not let manipulation, halt, curtail, derail her search for satisfaction, as her prowess escalates, no man on earth can stop, abate, she opposes forces bent, on her prostration.Another wonderful piece of filmmaking, from a great director, with a phenomenal leading lady who's in control.",positive
987,"Doctor Godwin Baxter brings Bella Baxter back to life, Bella is keen to grab life by the horns, and explore all that there is.First off, I watched this, wondering if there was something wrong with the screening, but it uses a right old mix of styles, going from an almost sepia visual, to striking, bold colour, it's a real mix of styles.I watched this after a fairly stressful day at work, and it totally took my mind off things, truly one of those movies that you escape into. I can't say it's a date night movie.I think this is going to be a film that you either love or hate, it is the most bizarre thing I've seen for many years, and I sat through the whole of Gormenghast.Surreal and crazy, yes, but it's also quite funny, I chuckled several times, it really is a wild mix.Credit to the cast, Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo are great, Emma Stone ours in an awesome performance, the way she moves, and that look on her face of curious wonder, what a talent she is.I guarantee you won't see another film like this all year.Bizarre and wonderful, 9/10.",positive
988,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
989,"High rating, I know, but keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. Nudity, profanity, quirkiness - and then a scene with Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo that made me decide to stop being nervous about the situation it seemed to be making fun of, and just accept whatever was thrown at me. So funny, smart and ultimately a full arch of characters. Several great performances, and a cast that put a lot of faith into the production. Everyone is going for broke - and if nothing else, you have to love their fearlessness. Emma Stone continues to impress me so much, and even Willem Dafoe can surprise you after all these years. One of the best movies I've seen in a decade!",positive
990,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
991,"This has an 8.5 rating currently at this moment and was the only movie on the most popular list above 7 so I checked it out.Most people I can guarantee will not like this. At best, it's an overly artsy movie, but I disagree with even heaping that much praise on it. The best I can say about it is that Emma Stone does do some good work as far as acting, but that's beside the point. What was she thinking here? Almost never does a better known actress do this kind of work; maybe before they get bigger roles when they're unknown, but she's almost two decades into her mainstream career.This is basically truly a 70's soft porn movie akin to Lady Chatterly or something like that you'd see on late night cable back in the nineties. It has that weird 1970's vibe to it. It's one softcore porn scene after another mainly with the exception of the very beginning and one hour of it, weirdly erotic, and excessively unnecessary. For people who have a fetish for that kind of stuff, they might like it. I can't see most people rating this high. It doesn't tick any boxes of entertainment quality, but it may be artsy for people wanting something far out there.",positive
992,"In an engaging cinematic experience, ""Poor Things"" captivates from the start, primarily due to its skillfully crafted storyline. The plot follows a woman discovering the world, her innocence stolen, paving the way for powerful messages about individual freedom, self-discovery, innocence, and malevolence. The raw and effective feminist critique stands out for its originality, steering clear of the clichés often found in mainstream films with similar messages.Yorgos Lanthimos, renowned for his unique and bizarre approach, doesn't disappoint, presenting a peculiar and artistically rich cinematic universe. The creation of a fictitious version of Lisbon within an alternate and surreal context adds intriguing layers to the narrative, providing a true visual delight.Emma Stone's portrayal is the heart of the film, committing wholeheartedly to a demanding role. Her extraordinary performance delivers an emotionally engaging experience, deserving recognition in the awards season, potentially even earning her the coveted Best Actress Oscar.The original artistic flair of ""Poor Things"" is remarkable, shining through with impeccable cinematography that surpasses other esteemed productions. The film is bold, irreverent, and genuinely different, offering a unique experience for those willing to explore uncharted cinematic territories.However, despite its many merits, ""Poor Things"" is not without criticism. A segment, particularly during the boat journey to Greece, slows down, becoming somewhat tedious. Trimming 20 minutes from the overall duration could enhance the film's pacing.Its strength in originality also becomes a vulnerability. The unusual nature of the production may not resonate with all viewers, making it a film that requires an open mind to be fully appreciated. Ultimately, ""Poor Things"" stands as a remarkable cinematic work, leaving a lasting impression on those who venture into its peculiar and captivating narrative.",positive
993,"I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. ""Poor Things"" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things"" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",neutral
994,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
995,"The trailers hide the fact that the movie is all about sex. It's a soft porn movie that does not leave the main characters sexual exploits for the whole movie. Great sets and visually beautiful but the plot is very poor. Big actors who actually perform well in a weak, second rate and dragged out storyline. I would not recommend this movie. I believe the film is supposed to be a portrayal of female liberation but the final product is a degradation of the young female lead. It had the potential to be a good movie but I feel that the writers got lost and ran out of ideas and so just kept with the sex theme throughout.",positive
996,"Yorgos Lanthimos strikes once again with a bizarre, twisted, and outrageously entertaining masterclass of filmmaking.Poor Things is an absurd story following the re-animated Bella Baxter, who embarks on a journey of discovery with the caddish Mark Ruffalo. Suffice it to say that it is a bizarre story that is so rich in detail and layered with intriguing themes.What maybe struck me most, or at least surprised me most about this film is the visuals. It's a stunning film to look at, with such a rich colour palette and beautiful set designs. The creative design decisions made on this film were just sublime.Then there are the performances. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo both give absolutely inspired turns. Emma Stone brings a brilliant and curiously captivating energy to the role of Bella Baxter which is just fascinating and endlessly entertaining to watch. She thoroughly deserves all her plaudits for such a committed and remarkable display. Mark Ruffalo gives an absurd performance that is utterly ridiculous but works so well. If Emma Stone weren't so good he'd have stolen the show. To top this all off there's a thoroughly brilliant role for Willem Dafoe who is superb.As if all this isn't enough, the script is razor sharp, with brilliantly witty dialogue, great jokes, and well executed and deep emotional moments.Admittedly this film might not be for everyone due to some of its stranger elements, but it really is not one to be missed.",positive
997,"Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",positive

999,"This movie dials pretty much everything up to 11 - the wit, the rudeness, the production design, the gruesomeness, the performances, the sex...and the humanity too. I knew the basic set-up, but nothing could have prepared me for the 140 minutes after that. It is a movie that wants to make you laugh and cringe while thinking deep thoughts about what it means to be alive and have a conscience and feel things like pleasure and guilt. While some scenes leaned into certain elements more than others, Lanthimos succeeds at making the audience come face-to-face with questions that are not typical at the movies in 2024. And he gets a lot of help bringing his vision to life from the amazing performances. Stone and Ruffalo are especially good. It is a bizarre ride, but you won't regret going on it. (Or maybe you will, but i guarantee you won't have seen anything quite like it!)",positive
1000,"This film is primarily satire. It is a playful take on the Frankenstein template: there's a creator and a ""monster"", except the creator is burdened with his own monster-like and doomed qualities (a victim of experimentation himself) and the creation is blessed with beauty, free will, and power.The gender-swap is what makes all the difference: Bella (given the name of ""beauty"" rather than a monstrous name) would have been a ""born sexy yesterday"" trope, i.e. That common 80s-and-earlier trope, where a sexually appealing grown woman has the mind and world-knowledge of a child, therefore relying on a male mentor to teach her - and use her. But she fully turns the trope on its head when her free will shines through from the very beginning, as she quickly realises she can seize her own freedom and become whoever she likes.Freudian influences aside (we see Bella going through various stages of maturity, governed by the ""ego"" and then the ""superego""), there isn't too much to analyse about this film's depth. It's all pretty self-explanatory, while also unhinged and most of all fun. I feel that some critics' obsession with finding deep meanings just because it's an art-house film takes away from the film's main mood, which is unapologetically entertaining, up to the very final scene.Visually, there's so much to enjoy. All the Victorian and Steampunk references, in an unlikely and yet entirely successful marriage with Surrealist imagery (I especially got some Frida Kahlo vibes). After seeing the trailer, I was worried about whether and how the heavy use of CGI landscapes would work, but it really works just fine, specifically within those Surrealist aesthetics.It's a film that doesn't let you get bored for one second. Emma Stone just slays every single scene, with mind-blowing physicality. All her scene partners are equally enchanting. I loved Mark Ruffalo's buffoonery as Bella's increasingly desperate lover and Willem Dafoe's eerie and almost heartbreaking presence as ""God"" (short for Godfried, but you see what they did there).It's unique.It's masterful.It's great cinema.",positive
