1,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
2,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
3,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
4,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
5,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
6,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
7,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
8,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
9,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
10,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
11,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
12,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
13,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
14,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
15,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
16,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
17,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
18,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
19,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
20,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
21,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
22,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
23,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter.",positive

It is not just one scene to make a point for the ongoing story - no. It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said. This is distasteful.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". And a sane person would find it difficult to watch it to the end.",negative

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
27,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
28,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
29,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
30,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
31,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

34,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
35,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
36,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
37,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
38,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here.

I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
40,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
41,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
42,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
43,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
44,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
45,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
46,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
47,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
48,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
52,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
53,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
54,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
55,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
56,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
57,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
58,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
59,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
60,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
61,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
62,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
63,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
64,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
66,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
67,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
68,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
69,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
70,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

77,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
78,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
79,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
80,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
81,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
82,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
83,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
84,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
85,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
86,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
87,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
88,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
89,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
91,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
92,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
93,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
94,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
95,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

102,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
103,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
104,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
105,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
106,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
107,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
108,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
109,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
110,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
111,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
112,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
113,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
114,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

116,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
117,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies.

119,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
120,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
121,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
122,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
123,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

127,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
128,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
129,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
130,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

134,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
135,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
136,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
137,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
138,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
139,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
141,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
142,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
143,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
144,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
145,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
146,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland.

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

152,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
153,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
154,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
155,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
157,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
158,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
159,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
160,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
161,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
162,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
163,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
164,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

166,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
167,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

168,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
169,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
170,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

177,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
178,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
179,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
180,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
181,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
182,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
183,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
184,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
185,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
186,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
187,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
188,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
189,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
190,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
191,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
192,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
193,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
194,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
195,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

202,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
203,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
204,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
205,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
206,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
207,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
208,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
209,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
210,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
211,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
212,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
213,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
214,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

216,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
217,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
218,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
219,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
220,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
221,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
222,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
223,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

227,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
228,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
229,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
230,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

234,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
235,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
236,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
237,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
238,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
239,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
242,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
243,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
244,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
245,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
246,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
248,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
252,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
253,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
254,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
255,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

259,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
260,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
261,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
262,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
263,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
264,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
265,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
266,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
267,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
268,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
269,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
270,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
271,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland.

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

277,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
278,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
279,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive

If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
281,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
282,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
283,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
284,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
285,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
286,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
287,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
288,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
289,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
290,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
291,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
292,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
293,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
294,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
295,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption.

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

302,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
303,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
304,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
305,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
306,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
307,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
308,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
309,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
310,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
311,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
312,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
313,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
314,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

316,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
317,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
319,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
320,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny.

The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
322,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

327,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
328,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
329,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
330,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

334,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
335,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
336,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
337,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
338,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now.

Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
339,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
342,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
343,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
344,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
345,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
346,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
347,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
348,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter.",positive

It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said. This is distasteful.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". And a sane person would find it difficult to watch it to the end.",negative

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
352,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
353,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
354,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
355,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

359,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
360,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
361,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
362,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
363,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
364,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
366,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
367,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
368,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
369,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
370,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

377,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
378,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
379,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
380,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
381,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
382,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
383,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
384,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
385,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
386,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
387,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
388,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
389,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
390,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
391,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
392,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
393,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
394,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
395,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption.

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

402,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
403,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
404,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
405,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
406,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
407,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
408,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
409,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
410,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
411,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
412,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
413,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
414,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

416,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
417,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies.

There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
420,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
423,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

427,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
428,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
429,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
430,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

434,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
435,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
436,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
437,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
438,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
439,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

441,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
442,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
443,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
444,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
445,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
446,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland.

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
452,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
453,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
454,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
455,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

459,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
460,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
461,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
462,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
463,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
464,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
466,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
467,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
468,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
469,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
470,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

477,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
478,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
479,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
480,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
481,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
482,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
483,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
484,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
485,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
486,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
487,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
488,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
489,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
490,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
491,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
492,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
494,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
495,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption.

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

502,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
503,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
504,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
505,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
506,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
507,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
508,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
509,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
510,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
511,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
512,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
513,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
514,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

516,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
517,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies.

There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
520,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption.

Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
524,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter.",positive
525,".This one feels off for a reason.According to the ratings, many people missed the obvious or they have bad morals:This one contains adult material. Lots of it. Disgusting soft porn material. It is not just one scene to make a point for the ongoing story - no. It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said. This is distasteful.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". And a sane person would find it difficult to watch it to the end.",negative

I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
527,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
528,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
529,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
530,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
532,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
533,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

534,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
535,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
536,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
537,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
538,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
539,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

541,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
542,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
543,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
544,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
545,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
546,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland.

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
552,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
553,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
554,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
555,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

559,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
560,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
561,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
562,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
563,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
564,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
565,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
566,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
567,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
568,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
569,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
570,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
571,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland.

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

577,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
578,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
579,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
580,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
582,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
583,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
584,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
585,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
586,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
587,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
588,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
589,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
591,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
592,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
593,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
594,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
595,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

602,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
603,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
604,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
605,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
606,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
607,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
608,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
609,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
610,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
611,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
612,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
613,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
614,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

616,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
617,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies.

And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
620,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption.

This is distasteful.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". And a sane person would find it difficult to watch it to the end.",negative
626,"Poor Things simply just wasn't for me. I really don't like to say I hate a movie... so we'll just go with ""it wasn't for me"". I did appreciate the production design and performances, but a lot of the cinematography and writing/directing choices just didn't work for me. Just a little too weird for my tastes. And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
627,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
628,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
629,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
630,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
631,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
632,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
633,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

634,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
635,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
636,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
637,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
638,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
639,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

641,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
642,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented.

643,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
644,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
645,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
646,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland.

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

652,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
653,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
654,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
655,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

659,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
660,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
661,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
662,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that.

There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
664,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
665,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
666,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
667,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
668,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
669,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
670,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
671,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland.

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

677,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
678,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
679,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
680,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with.

Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
683,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
684,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
685,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
686,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
687,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
688,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
689,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
691,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
692,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

693,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
694,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
695,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

702,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
703,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
704,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
705,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
706,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
707,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
708,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
709,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
710,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
711,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
712,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
713,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
714,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
716,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
717,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different.

719,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
720,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption.

727,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
728,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
729,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
730,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
731,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
732,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
733,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
734,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
735,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
736,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
737,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
738,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now.

Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
739,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

741,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
742,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies.

744,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
745,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
746,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
747,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
748,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
752,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
753,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
754,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
755,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

759,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
760,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
761,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
762,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
763,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
764,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
765,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
766,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
767,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
768,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
769,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
770,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
771,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland.

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

777,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
778,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
779,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
780,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
784,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
785,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
786,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
787,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that.

Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep.

789,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

791,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
792,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different.

794,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
795,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption.

802,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive

If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
805,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
806,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
807,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
808,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
809,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
810,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
811,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
812,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
813,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
814,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
816,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
817,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive

I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
819,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
820,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption.

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

827,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
828,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
829,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
830,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
831,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
832,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
833,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
834,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
835,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
836,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
837,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
838,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
839,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

841,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
842,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
844,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
845,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
846,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
847,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

852,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
853,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
854,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
855,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

859,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
860,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
861,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
862,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
863,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now.

Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here.

In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
867,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
868,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
869,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
870,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
871,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
877,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
878,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
879,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
880,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater.

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

884,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
885,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
886,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
887,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
888,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
889,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
890,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
891,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
892,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
893,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
894,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
895,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
896,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland.

I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral

These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

902,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
903,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
904,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
905,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
906,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
907,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
908,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
909,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
910,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
911,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
912,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
913,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
914,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
915,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
916,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
917,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
918,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
919,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
920,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral

The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption.

I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted.

927,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
928,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
929,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
930,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral
931,"Being weird can be interesting, but if being weird is THE MAIN feature a movie has to offer it's viewers then I can not get interested, let alone be mesmirised or captivated by it.Hurrah for the arthouse movie fans, of whom a niche group will love it to pieces, but for the casual viewer or Emma Stone fan, I would definitely not dare recommend it. It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
932,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative
933,"The premise of this film is that a suicidal pregnant woman jumps off a bridge and is brought back to life by a mad scientist who puts her unborn child's brain into her head. She then embarks on a ""self-discovery"" journey to apparent liberation. This involves her having sex with as many men as possible throughout the film in graphic detail, mostly while she either still has the mind of a child or is very clearly mentally challenged. Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo. It's a nasty film in my opinion and I wish there was a zero stars option.",neutral
934,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
935,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
936,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
937,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
938,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
939,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive

941,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
942,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating.

I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
944,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
945,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny.

The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
947,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
948,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out.

After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could.

It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said.

952,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
953,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
954,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
955,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive

Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

959,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
960,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
961,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
962,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
963,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now.

Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
964,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
967,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
968,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
969,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
970,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
971,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
972,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
973,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral

The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter.",positive

It is not just one scene to make a point for the ongoing story - no. It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said. This is distasteful.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". And a sane person would find it difficult to watch it to the end.",negative

And felt way too long. I wanted to like it so bad, and was so disappointed to find myself disliking it so much.I know it's been getting good reviews from most people - I'm in the minority here! So if you're interested, definitely check it out! I'm a huge supporter of going to see a film if you are interested in it and deciding for yourself how you feel!",negative
977,"Poor Things (2023) is an ostensibly feminist film directed by a man, written by a man, and based on a book written by a man... and it shows. This isn't the feminist masterpiece many people claim it to be, and there are a few deeply problematic elements that make most of it feel downright icky. It's about an extremely sheltered (read: imprisoned) young woman's coming of age (mostly via sexual liberation) and the journey she takes to outgrow the various men who seek to control her in one way or another.The film takes the 'born sexy yesterday' trope and pushes the sickly male fantasy even further by making Emma Stone's Bella not only naïve but actually, at least to begin with, a literal baby inside an adult's body. The concept is that an experimental surgeon (a make-up-caked Willem Dafoe) finds a recently deceased pregnant woman and decides to put the infant's brain into the mother's skull and reanimate her. The unborn child is birthed directly into an adult body, skipping over the physical development but still going through the mental development. It's mentioned that her motor skills will come slowly, but that her mind will develop at an advanced rate. This doesn't really make sense, as absurdist and impressionistic as it is intended to be, and it seems to be accelerated purely because the piece doesn't want to be scrutinised over the icky insinuations of its own concept.The narrative can't take place over more than a couple of years, but it's heavily implied that the hero has grown from being a babbling baby at the start to a self-actualised woman at the end. The timeline for all this is uncomfortably ambiguous, though. Although Emma Stone and writer Tony McNamara have said Bella is actually about sixteen, mentally speaking, when the sex starts (which is still very young, especially in relation to the men she gets involved with, but is at least more akin to the generally accepted age for media portrayals of sexual coming of ages), her mental age is consistently ambiguous. She still walks with the ungainly gait of a toddler when she's supposedly close to the brain age of twenty and she remains acutely innocent even as her general maturity begins to show. The capacity to learn and grow that comes with getting older is separate to the knowledge you gain from having actual experiences, and there is a point at which it's evident Bella is capable of understanding the world around her like an adult even though there are still plenty of things she has yet to be exposed to and are therefore a mystery to her. Even if she is sixteen when we first see her do the deed, the sequence in question - as well as almost all those that follow it - still boils down to a creepy older man having sex with - at oldest - a teenager who is incredibly naïve and unaware that the bloke is taking advantage of her. As others have pointed out, children can't give consent, and misguided consent isn't consent either (you can't consent to something without properly understanding it).Even if Bella wasn't younger than she appeared, her sheltered sincerity would still craft a dynamic that plays into that odd male power fantasy of engaging with a woman who isn't equally as experienced as them. The men in the movie are totally taken with Bella's childlike demeanor, falling head over heels for her because - not in spite - of her younger mental state, and that's massively unsettling. Of course, that is kind of the point. However, the story frames Bella's experiences with these men as a means of her achieving adulthood and ultimately doesn't decry them as much as it should. The most likeable male character (Ramy Youssef) calls her lovely as soon as he sees her, even though she's acting like a toddler, and then proposes to her with the full knowledge that he's proposing to someone who, again, is in her early teens at the absolute latest (this isn't treated as a problem, and he is positioned as the only 'good' guy left by the film's end). It's all just a gross variation of a bizarre male fantasy that really shouldn't be something anyone fantasises about.I'm not sure if it's to the film's credit or to my own that none of the sex scenes ever feel sexy, primarily because it always feels downright wrong to be seeing Bella participate in them. Despite the fact that she's played by an attractive adult actress, you can't separate what you're seeing from the context in which you're seeing it. You never forget that the character herself isn't as old as the person portraying her, even when her mental age might have caught up to her physical age, but it's difficult to say whether that's due to the filmmaking itself or due to the way in which the viewer reacts to what they're seeing. To be fair, the sexual scenarios are all filmed with a kind of detachment that massively reduces their in-the-moment male gaze, even though it's still apparent and runs throughout the actual narrative (despite the female protagonist and themes of female liberation).All of this begs the question: what about the concept of a baby's brain being put into an adult's body indicates it should be used to kickstart a story that's primarily about sexual liberation? Why is Bella's development viewed almost entirely through the lens of sexual discovery? It's a very weird place to take the concept; there are many potent elements that comprise someone's journey into adulthood. It's a massive missed opportunity to explore some of these aspects. Perhaps the picture's second most prominent aspect is its depiction of the patriarchy and its protagonist's almost accidental breaking of it (at least when it comes to her specific experience). It gets really close to making a point about this, but it settles for making most of the men in the movie look like total idiots and, as great as that is, it feels like more could have been done. Others have pointed out there's no mention of menstruation, which is a key milestone on the path to womanhood, which indicates that the piece isn't as concerned with the female experience of growing up as it thinks it is. By focusing so much on its sexual aspects and going out of its way to make them as inappropriate as possible (one-upping the 'born sexy yesterday' trope by throwing a literal infant into the fray), it's just very yucky overall and it isn't even done in a way designed to challenge the audience (it almost feels like it wants you to forget about the specifics of its underlying concept after a short while).It may sound like I hate the feature, but I don't. From a technical standpoint, it's well-made in pretty much every area and it has an unconventional approach to its aesthetic that makes it distinct from its peers. Its performances are also all really good, with Stone impressing the most. It isn't especially boring, even if it isn't particularly compelling for long stretches, and it also inspires a fair bit of thought if you're willing to engage with it critically. You can call it a lot of things, but bland isn't exactly one of them.The feature isn't the laugh riot many people are claiming it to be, but it is mildly amusing (I don't think I actually laughed once, but I did smile a few times and did one of those sharp nose inhales on one occasion). The first movement is rather difficult to get through; I didn't particularly enjoy any of it. When the piece pops into colour and starts its second act, it slowly gets more interesting and enjoyable. It also becomes even more visually appealing, with fantastic steampunk-esque sets and elaborate frilly costuming captured with delightfully vivid cinematography. The best parts of the picture aren't when it's indulging in its infamous sex scenes (which, despite their frequency, aren't actually as explicit or gratuitous as their reputation would suggest), but instead when Bella is on her journey of self-discovery. This segment leans into the increasing frustration of her insecure companion (an accent-chewing Mark Ruffalo), providing space for the picture to begin to critique the caveman male ego, alongside her exposure to things like philosophy and suffering, which paves the way for her to develop her intellectual and emotional aspects independently of her sexuality (which, for large portions of the affair, is the only way she gets to express and explore herself, cementing the flick's somewhat misguided concept that sexual liberation is the highest form of female empowerment - an idea which flattens feminism, as well as the female experience itself, to only one of its many elements). Though it doesn't fully explore its potentially powerful themes and arcs, it's intriguing to see the protagonist grow as a character and drive the men around her to insanity simply by being entirely unconcerned with their notions of what she should be. The feature slowly but surely becomes more enjoyable as it goes along. Unfortunately, it then takes a hard turn into a sort of epilogue that's incredibly on-the-nose and feels unnecessary. It also introduces an outright villain (Christopher Abbott) whose inclusion only really serves to dilute the misconduct of every other male character (including the 'good'-coded Fiancée, who - let's not forget - decided to marry a child in an adult's body). This segment tanks the pacing and highlights the fact that it's just way too long overall. This goes hand in hand with the other narrative issues to create an experience that's ultimately rather disappointing. It's not just that its narrative is misguided at best, it's also that it isn't that entertaining. It isn't terrible, and there is a stretch where it's even rather good, but I don't find myself particularly moved by any of it and it isn't something I'd actively recommend. Despite its surface-level yet undeniable visual wonder and its genuinely strong performances, it's a bit of a slog to get through and it often makes you feel uncomfortable in the worst kind of way (it's not challenging, it's just creepy).",positive
978,"While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide. What a bizarre world we are living in.",neutral
979,"A movie that's decorated as something special with glitz and glamour that is meant to convey a deeper meaning but at its root is simply perverted. A mad scientist / doctor finds a woman who committed suicide with a baby inside of her and manages to implant the brain of the child into the dead woman. If that isn't enough to scare you away then the fact that the movie then somewhat tries to convince you that was the ethical thing to do is even more worrisome .The movie then shows Bella Baxter, the woman with the brain of her child inside of her, become exploited over and over. You watch sex scene after sex scene and the directors main goal with all this is to show that Bella is escaping her imprisonment from the men in her life and going on an adventure to pursue 'happiness'. The huge problem with all of this is that Bella has the brain of a child, and if you re watching some of these sex scenes with that in mind it's not a woman pursuing happiness and liberty but child exploitation.The fact that Hollywood not only accepts this but encourages and awards this concept is deeply concerning. There are so many other ways to show women's liberation and empowerment than what they have done here.The acting , camera work, and costumes are good, but the plot is chaotic. The script is extremely pretentious and is used to try to make you believe in some powerful underling message.Overall, certainly could have gone without seeing this one. Its greatest strength is that it certainly makes you have emotions towards it, but for me none of those feelings were positive.",positive
980,"For the reason that I'm completely unsure who this film is aimed at (aside from film lovers like myself), I will not be recommending this one, but I'll also state that this is one of my favourite films in years. If that intrigues you, then maybe Poor Things is your cup of tea. Yorgos Lanthimos is a director with a clear vision that I deeply admire. I don't love all of his work, but the worst I can say about any of his films is that I appreciate them. Well, Poor Things just jumped to the top of my list of favourite Lanthimos pictures. This is a pure work of art, in the weirdest, most bizarre way possible. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the brilliance of Poor Things. Let's dive right in.The film begins as Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds the dead body of a pregnant woman. After taking her corpse to his lab, he makes an incision and removes the baby from her body. He then takes out the woman's brain and replaces it with her baby's brain. Then, much like in the style of Frankenstein, he reanimates the body and she comes to life. He refers to her as Bella (Emma Stone) and refuses to let her leave home. Much like an infant, Bella learns to walk, speak, and also learns every detail of her body. Upon meeting Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), the two of them form a connection and flock away to roam the world together and get very intimate. That's the jist of what sets this film in motion, so if that already turns you off, I would recommend not watching it.If you're still intrigued, well then this film is a masterpiece. This story is told in a very unique style. As they visit real places in the world, it's done in an incredibly artistic and surreal way. This film is aware that the premise is impossible, so it makes the visuals and details match the absurdity and I couldn't get enough of it. The production designers, art directors, set decorator, costume designer, and the makeup department all deserve endless praise for their work here. They brought Lanthimos' vision to life in stunning fashion. The look of this film blew me away, on top of me already loving the wackiness of the story.Honestly, all I want to do is gush about this film. The camerawork, the score, every performance, and even the incredibly worded dialogue all just made this a remarkable achievement. Emma Stone deserves an Oscar for her performance here too. I haven't seen such an odd performance done this well and this committed in quite some time. She's a true revelation here and her chemistry with Mark Ruffalo was hilarious. He also deserves all of the recognition he's receiving for this.Poor Things is a very rare kind of filmmaking that doesn't come around very often. Yes, it's weird beyond what words could ever describe and I even watched a couple of people walk out of my screening, but I just can't feel that way. The craft onscreen is undeniable and I could only dream of ever being able to make a film this masterful. In every conceivable way, I believe this is my favourite film of 2023. If you're someone who is up for watching anything and willing to give anything a shot, I seriously can't recommend this film enough. I'm currently adding it to my list of favourites, ever.",neutral

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
982,"The trailer was a total lie, they made this look like a quirky Sci Fi romantic adventure. I thought it was going to be like bride of frankenstein. Instead its more like a cheap porno movie. Bella Baxter dies pregnant and they implant her babies brain into her body so she has the mind of an infant. Immediately all the men around her want to screw her and notice how pretty she is, the father even tries to pawn her off on his assistant. Once bella finds out how to masturbate she is obsessed with sex. And for the next two hours we watch a girl who has the mentality of a child screw a bunch of men, all of who are talking advantage of her. She even goes to a brothel and although she agrees to it, we watch her get raped by old men. Dongs swinging in the air and all. The audience didn't know whether to laugh or be disturbed. The one who comes on to her first is ""Max"" the scientists assistant. He is suppose to be the good guy here... He is such a loser he could never get a girl on his own, he needs to manipulate a child. A typical molester to which the audience is suppose to have empathy for, SICK. This movie should have been 45 shorter, the sex scenes were too long, I was like ""OK enough already"" we get it, people were groaning in the theater. Two stars for art director, the steam punk setting was cool but wasted. This movie went around in circles, sex, sex, sex, yawn. 2 stars, what a stinker of a perverted film.",negative

Even if she really is ""of age"" by the time the sex starts or if these guys really don't know that she has the mind of a child, they have to know that she at the very least is mentally handicapped since it's made abundantly clear by the story and her acting, yet they continue anyway. To me that is textbook sexual abuse/rape, not liberation, and makes watching the proceedings extremely uncomfortable since they also filmed it in an erotic way and it drags on and on. As an aside, and no offense to Ms. Stone, but watching Emma Stone participate in porn was never on my list of things to do. If it were me, I would feel embarrassed and ashamed to have participated in the film. I'm flabbergasted that so many people seem to enjoy it and it's very sad to me that this is not only approved of but lauded after everything the industry JUST went through with #MeToo.

984,"If you've seen any Yorgos Lathimos film, Poor Things is everything you would have expected and hoped for. If you haven't seen any of his films, buckle up. That's all I'll say.Poor Things is a thoroughly outrageous romp. It's trippy, disturbing and brutally funny. You could summarize this film as, essentially, a feminist spin on A Clockwork Orange. Both films/novels explore the concept of freewill in an oppressive society. But while Alex struggles with his repugnant urges for ultra-violence, Bella struggles with her normal primal urges of sexual liberation and independence. What women are expected to do in this dystopian universe, Bella does the opposite, and much to the chagrin of her male caretakers. Despite being created in a laboratory by a mad scientist and saddled with the brain of the infant child she was pregnant with, Bella forms an insatiable appetite for exploring and thriving.Poor Things celebrates hedonism, but in a way that's both honest and humorous. Lathimos finds freewill to be as necessary as the air we breathe, and at times, that challenges so-called ""polite society"". Consider Bella an avatar for the id. Or, perhaps consider her a pioneer and a rebel. Whatever impression you make out of this, you will be blown away by Bella, who is truly the heart and soul of this entire movie. This is the defining role of Emma Stone's career. She captures a level of vulnerability and aching desire that we haven't seen from any actor in a long time.Poor Things holds nothing back. There's a lot of sex. A lot of awkward, unsexy, sex. Perhaps it's the most realistic sex we've ever seen in a film! The special effects here are some of the strangest and most inspired of Lathimos's entire career. Mark Ruffalo's performance as Duncan is by far the year's best comedic performance.If you're looking for a cinematic spectacle this holiday season, you've found it right here.",positive
985,"There is Terry Gilliam, then there is Tim Burton, then Gaspar Noé and now Yorgos Lanthimos. They all have one thing in common, they make very weird obscure movies. While Gilliam and Burton have been able to create some commercial appeal and a smidge of logical comprehension of their movies, Lanthimos proves there is no such thing here.I have no clue what I just watched or what the purpose of the film was. It seems like an exercise in abstract art laced with gratuitous sexual content, all for, at least to me, served no purpose at all. It was like Edward Scissors hand meets Jim Jarmusch meeting pørnhub.I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I started to skip through this mess.Most of it because it made no sense. How did Bella progress that quickly without aging with her child's brain? She went from barely being able to say one word to speaking normal and then engaging in adult courtship and sexual interactions.I still don't see why this movie was made, nor why it's getting this amount of praise.I would stay away from watching this.",neutral
986,I watched this the other day and my memory of it is mercifully starting to fade from it .They are trying to say it's ultimately feminist it's not. They also make the point it from a male perspective. Well isn't that unique- not! We have had films about women from the male perspective for decades nothing unique in that sense. I know Emma Stone is a producer but that doesn't mean it favors women.Ultimately to me it seemed more like an excuse to make a film ninetieth century pornography/ horror .A lot of the things in this film are simply gross and unnecessary.I would be all for a film about a free spirited woman exploring her sexuality among other things but this wasn't it . I also think it's strange that some think the only reason to dislike the movie is due to the sex and that you must be a prude.The bizarre acting and weird storyline just isn't that interesting. The CGI doesn't make the production values that impressive either.,neutral
987,"I gave this production a ""5"" for some remarkable visuals like the steampunk/Land of Oz cruise ship, and Willem Dafoe is fabulous is everything, BUT; the plot is like dumping a bag of Scrabble letters on the floor and calling it a ""story"". If there are some deep philosophical themes or character development arcs to learn from, they are well-hidden or so convoluted as to make them incomprehensible. I kept waiting for some ""aha!"" moment of clarity but it never came.Other reviewers have addressed - in excruciating detail - the disturbing implicated child molestation theme, but if nothing else the uncomfortable sex scenes are too numerous and too lengthy. The point (if there is one) could have been made without beating the audience over the head with a cinematic cudgel ala Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And what in the name of Dr Moreau was with the animal hybrids?BTW the current ""craze"" in Hollywood of making movies in a mix of color and black & white (""Oppenheimer"" and ""Maestro"" for example) has run its course, and the mix in this production has very little to do with the storyline....whatever that is.Frankly the positive reviews are either from people who equate meaningless oddities with high art, or studio minions getting paid to boost the total review rating - which is most likely. I've been in the business long enough to recognize pretentious but ultimately meaningless movie fluff, and this is certainly that. Ultimately the only ""Poor Things"" in this movie are the people who have to watch it.",neutral
988,"Some may say that this movie is unnecessarily too explicit, but that is the exact point of the message here - how one can see the world through fresh eyes, wanting to explore everything and paying attention only to the here and now. There are philosophical nuggets sprinkled throughout, reminding us that this exploratory hedonism is only a phase, ultimately becoming unsustainable, and paving the way for our protagonist to grow and mature. Emma Stone takes a risk with this complex role and it pays off. Now a two-time lead actress Oscar winner, she catapults herself into the same league as Jodie Foster, Tom Hanks, and Meryl Streep. And it is every bit well-deserved. Another big praise goes to the outstanding production design and cinematography here. ""Poor Things"" is a feast for the eyes with its absurd wide angles, fisheye view, vibrant colors, and psychedelic art.",neutral
989,"Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",positive
990,"A uniquely grotesque Frankensteinian coming-of-age conglomeration of Shakespearean-speak dialog; lavish period settings, scenery and costuming; steam punk inspired machinery; copious use of ultra-wide angle camera lenses; and, apparently the most important ingredient to the script-writer, a frequent shock-value infusion of graphically gratuitous nudity and soft-porn throughout, willingly depicted by actors of all shapes and sizes, not the least of which, our unabashed hope-this-gets-me-an-Oscar starlet. In the end, nothing more than heady snob-bait, and a bizarrely dark and prurient nightmare that ""entertains"" at the same level as the real-time viewing of a multi-car pile-up crash.",neutral
991,"Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.",positive
992,"Yorgos Lanthimos has already made a name for himself due to his directorial prowess; he's already a prominent figure amongst cinephiles for the kind of films he's been part of (The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite, to name a couple). ""Poor Things"" takes his credibility as a visionary filmmaker up a few notches as he conspicuously pushes the envelope further.Not only did he envision a bizarre yet fascinating world, but he also ensured the viewers did not lose interest in the middle. The writing is appropriately paced and has shrewd subtleties and nuances that fans of cinema will admire.The same remark applies for Emma Watson as well, for she had given her very best. I sure adored her for her performances many times in the past, but what she had done here was unprecedented. Bold, unapologetic, and more importantly, she had left no stone unturned in exploring the depths of the character she plays.This is unlike anything I have seen before; riveting, unconventional, yet all so captivating. Frankly speaking, it's quite hard to put my exact thoughts into words, though I did try my best.",positive
993,I cannot find many redeeming qualities in this movie nor can I find a sens unfortunately. Let's say I liked the colors and the actors but not the script. The story wasn't something exciting. I've read others have complaints about the immorality of this movie. I don't have those concerns. I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Tim Burton's movies. I didn't except that when I saw the high ratings I thought we would be getting something different. I am sorry to have wasted my time and the time of mt family by asking them to watch this painful movie.,negative
994,"Lack of creativity always focuses on the ""how"" instead of the ""what"". This film is a display of visual attempts to trap you in an absolute lack of well-crafted narrative. And I say visual attempt because it doesn't end up being something that visually makes sense. Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.",neutral
995,"Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",neutral
996,"This film has a very original selection of shots, a very nice cinematography and an excellent design. The plot is logical, but surrealist, a kind of modern Alice in Wonderland. The story is plenty of twisting points, making the narrative more and more interesting, with new adventures in the life of the protagonist.The main character is a woman who discovers the world, a film of ""the coming of age"", but told in an astounding, peculiar way......We can see the influence of De Palma, Herzog, Lynch, Buñuel, Polanski and other directors....The performance by Emma Stone is so good that the film could be used in Schools of Drama for teaching acting.Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role of the womanizer.Willem Dafoe (the Scarface man) plays an excellent suppporting role.The film is told in an expressionist code, but following a logical, solid and "" straight to the point "" narrative line.",neutral
997,"Truly, cannot believe why such fine actors like Dafoe, Stone and Ruffalo would have agreed to be cast after reading the debauched script. I am no shrinking violet or prude, but watching endless scenes of mechanical, gratuitous, sensual-less, soft-porn like sex, as well as constant vulgar language, images of warped experimental science, human suffering and animal cruelty, made me feel debased and bewildered as to why anyone would want to see this movie. The trailer gave no idea of how dark and grotesque this film is. My lesson is to study reviews more thoroughly hereon, as I was seriously misguided into thinking this movie would be a magical and quirky odyssey about a women's feminist awakening and empowerment. Quite the contrary, our protagonist Bella, appears to become enslaved to darkness. I clung on in hope that her interest in literature and socialism that spring half way through this movie might turn the plot around and there would be some redemption. But no, the writer kept slugging the audience with more and more horrors and grotesque garbage. Stay away and preserve your dignity.",neutral
998,"Clearly a lot of people enjoyed this grotesque movie, but it wasn't for me. Some of the scenes in it made me feel sick, and maybe they were supposed to, but it seemed unnecessary. Don't even get me started on how pretentious the movie was.I also found this movie very frustrating because the acting was good, the sets and costuming were good, and some scenes used striking cinematography. These things all made me feel like I should've liked the movie, but I don't. It could have been put to much better use.The sex and nudity is beyond gratuitous. I'm usually not bothered by sex scenes in movies, but for this particular film it felt perverted. Maybe the director has a weird fetish.Ultimately, this film made me want to crack my own head open and pour bleach over my brain. It's one of those movies I'd like to block out. I don't think I'll ever watch anything else by Lanthimos.",neutral
999,"Why is this file so vile, its main story is the innocence of a child thrown in to a adult world. The adults raising her are sick and twisted and she runs away only to be abused by a sick vile man(played by mark ruffalo) who abuses the young child and a pedophilia. After she leaves him she gets abused by men in a brothel. This film should surely win best picture as holywood ""Me too"" have surely given actresses their rights back. If this is not sick enough the child that gets abused is the baby of a mother who killed her self, well just the brain. This film would get banned, if any rating system could. The acting of william defoe was very good, how ever the plot was just weird and even had husband of dead woman wanting to have relationship with own daughter.",positive
1000,".This one feels off for a reason.According to the ratings, many people missed the obvious or they have bad morals:This one contains adult material. Lots of it. Disgusting soft porn material. It is not just one scene to make a point for the ongoing story - no. It is scene after scene.Why is that? ....what is the point of showing it over and over again?But shamefully, that isn't the problem yet. The problem is that the ""monster"" has the intellect of a child - if I understand correctly. Doesn't it?This is the point where nothing more needs to be said. This is distasteful.This is a failed attempt at a ""comedy-drama-romance"". And a sane person would find it difficult to watch it to the end.",negative
